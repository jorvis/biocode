"""
A memory-efficient script for subsampling single or paired-end FASTQ files
randomly (rather than taking the first N, or some other non-random approach)
while keeping mate pairs together in order (if running with paired-end options)

As with any script, the use of 'random' is relatively subjective.   You should
be safe though, unless you somehow plan on using FASTQ selection for cryptographic
purposes.  Don't.

In terms of compute complexity this is at best O(n) and at worst O(2n).  
The input file (or left file in the case of paired-end data) must be read once to
get a read count (unless you pass the --input_read_count option), then a
second time to do the subsampling, but no more than one record (4 lines) is ever
held in memory at a time.

The best other implementation of this I could find was in C, but required the
storage of an array of index positions.  I wrote this script to subsample 200
million reads out of a fileset of 2.5 billion, and this took too much memory.

Referenced C version:
    http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~dcjones/fastq-tools/fastq-sample.html

Python implementation which has the same issue:
    http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/randomly-sampling-reads-from-a-fastq-file/

Overview of steps:

1.  Parse --single or --left files to get a read count (skipped if --input_read_count provided)
2.  Pass through files once, randomly selecting reads based on the probability
    needed for each to get the requested --output_read_count

So, in practice, if you know the read count beforehand, the complexity will most often
be around O(n)

Probability multiplier:

Why is this needed?  If you have a set of 100 reads and ask for 10 to be selected,
this script applies the probability of selecting each one in a test as they are parsed.
Naturally, sometimes you might select 10, sometimes 12, sometimes 8.  The case where
more reads would be selected than desired is easy, just stop when you have enough.  But
how do you handle when less are selected?  If you did a second pass, you'd have to
index the positions of all those selected the first time, which gets us back into
memory issues.  The solution I've implemented here is to slightly increase the probability
of selecting any given read to provide a buffer, which is as arbitrary as performing
a second, indexed pass.  By default, this probability increase is 5% (1.05) but you can
set this to be higher/lower using the --probability_multiplier option.

If not enough reads are selected after a full pass the script returns an error.

Output:

The files created are defined using the --output_base option.  If processing a single
file, this will just append .fastq to the value passed.  If processing paired-end
files, the following will be created:

    {output_base}.R1.fastq
    {output_base}.R2.fastq

This is true regardless of how many input (comma-delimited) files are passed, only
one output file will be written per direction.

Assumptions:

Input reads can be in raw FASTQ format or compressed with a .gz extension.  If
passing paired-end data, all pairwise entries must be in the same order within
their files (this is very common.)
